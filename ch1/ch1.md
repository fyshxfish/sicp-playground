# Chapter 1 (Dirty Note)

## about Exercise 1.6

`new-if` defined in this exercise is a **function** instead of a special form like `if`, therefore the parameters of this function must be evaluated before the procedure application, which causes the endless recursion of the third param `sqrt-iter`.

[more](https://sicp-solutions.net/post/sicp-solution-exercise-1-6/)

-> the semantics of functions(like `new-if`) and special forms (like `if`) differ?


## about **recursive process** and **iterative process**

- resume computation

- implementation on register machine without auxiliary memory

## **recursive procedure** v.s. **recursive process**
